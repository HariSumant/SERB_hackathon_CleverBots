First the point distribution is random as measured by its spectrum having blue noise. Second it is well spaced in the sense that the minimum separation distance between samples is large compared to the maximum coverage distance between a domain point and a sample i.e. its Voronoi cell aspect ratios are small. It is well known that maximizing one of these properties destroys the other uniform random points have no aspect ratio bound and the vertices of an equilateral triangular tiling have no randomness. However we show that there is a lot of room in the middle to get good values for both. Maximal Poisson disk sampling provides and blue noise. We show that a standard optimization technique can improve the well spacedness while preserving randomness. Given a random point set our Opt beta algorithm iterates over the points and for each point locally optimizes its Voronoi cell aspect ratio . It can improve to a large fraction of the theoretical bound given by a structured tiling improving from 1.0 to around 0.8 about half way to 0.58 while preserving most of the randomness of the original set. In terms of both and randomness the output of Opt compares favorably to alternative point improvement techniques such as centroidal Voronoi tessellation with a constant density function which do not target directly. We demonstrate the usefulness of our output through meshing and filtering applications.
